# GUI Computer Use Evaluation

This repository is for AI research on GUI automation systems, specifically focusing on GUI Computer Use evaluation.

## Repository Contents

- `aria_ui_vllm.py` - Aria-UI implementation using vLLM for GUI grounding
- `utils.py` - Utility functions for coordinate drawing and image processing

## About

This repository was created as part of a master's thesis research project on GUI automation systems. It integrates the Aria-UI framework for GUI grounding and evaluation.

## Usage

The `aria_ui_vllm.py` file contains an implementation that uses vLLM for efficient inference with the Aria-UI model. This file was copied from the original Aria-UI repository to provide vLLM support for GUI grounding tasks.

## Dependencies

- vLLM
- Transformers
- PIL (Pillow)
- Aria-UI model

## Research Context

This work is part of research exploring GUI Computer Use evaluation frameworks and their integration with modern AI systems for GUI automation.
